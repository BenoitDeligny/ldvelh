# Frontend Progression Rules (Updated April 7th, 2024)

- **Marker Types & Colors:**
    - Markers are buttons representing steps (numbers) or screen navigation (letters).
    - Numeric markers have a fixed background color defined in `screenData.js`: **Green** (`greenNumber`) or **Orange** (`orangeNumber`).
    - Navigation markers (letters A, B, C...) currently have `type: 'greenNumber'` in `screenData.js` but are styled **Blue** via CSS (`.marker.navLetter`).

- **Initial State & Clickability:**
    - Player starts at progression Step 1.
    - **Green** number markers: Initially **active** (full opacity, pointer cursor) and **clickable** (opens progression modal for their number).
    - **Orange** number markers: Initially **inactive** (dimmed opacity, not-allowed cursor) and **not clickable**.
    - **Letter** navigation markers: Initially **active** (full opacity, pointer cursor) and **clickable** (navigates to the corresponding screen hash).

- **Dynamic Marker Appearance & Behavior:**
    - **Green** number markers: Remain **always active** (visuals and clickability) regardless of the player's current step.
    - **Orange** number markers:
        - Become **Active** (full opacity, pointer cursor, clickable for progression) when they match the `currentPlayerStep`.
        - Once activated, they **remain permanently Active** (visuals and clickability for progression) even if they are no longer the `currentPlayerStep` or the player changes screens. This relies on tracking visited steps (`visitedSteps` set in state).
        - If never activated, they remain **Inactive** (dimmed, not clickable).
    - **Letter** navigation markers: Remain **always active** (visuals and clickability for navigation) under the current rules.

- **Non-Linear Progression:**
    - Each number step (1-30) defines 1 to 3 **choices** leading to other steps (numbers) or specific screens (letters).
    - A choice targeting a screen letter (e.g., 'C') directs the player to the **lowest number defined on that screen** (e.g., Screen C starts at number 21).
    - The progression path ensures all numbers (1-30) are reachable.

- **Progression Modal Interaction:**
    - Clicking an **Active number marker** (Green anytime, Orange if current step or previously visited) opens a modal specific to that step number.
    - The modal **blocks interaction** with the elements behind it (overlay).
    - The modal displays the available **choices** for that step (e.g., "Aller à 7", "Aller à l'écran B").
    - Clicking a choice button in the modal:
        1. Closes the current modal.
        2. Updates the player's current progression step.
        3. If the target is a number on a *different* screen, navigates to that screen.
        4. Updates the markers on the (potentially new) screen to reflect the new active/inactive states.
        5. Opens the modal for the *new* current step (if it has choices). If the new step has no choices, it might show an informational message instead.
